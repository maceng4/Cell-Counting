# Cell-Counting
This program reads in microscope images of cells. Through different methods selected by the user, it counts cells and returns the number of neurons in an image.


# One of the first things we want to do is be able to import images
# Place here functions to import images



# Then we want to initialize a class: cellector
# with various functions that will: alter images (cell filtering), find neurons and not-neurons (cell finding), and count cells
